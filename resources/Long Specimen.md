Sud Aviation Caravelle
======================

The Sud Aviation SE 210 Caravelle was the world's first short/medium-range jet [airliner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner), produced by the French [Sud Aviation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sud_Aviation) firm. Its maiden flight occurred in 1955 when the company was known as [SNCASE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNCASE). The Caravelle was one of the most successful European first-generation [jetliners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jetliners), selling throughout Europe and even penetrating the United States market, with an order for 20 from [United Airlines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines). The Caravelle established the aft-mounted engine, clean-wing design that has since been used on a wide variety of aircraft.

Design and development
----------------------

On 12 October 1951, the Comité du Matériel Civil[^1] published a specification for a medium-range aircraft, which was later sent to the aviation industry by the Direction Technique et Industrielle[^2]. This called for an aircraft carrying 55 to 65 passengers and 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) of cargo on routes up to 2,000 km (1,100 [nmi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautical_mile); 1,200 [mi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile)) with a cruising speed of about 600 km/h (320 [kn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(unit)); 370 [mph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_per_hour)). The type and number of engines were not specified. Various design studies for aircraft in this category had been underway since 1946 by several of the leading French aircraft manufacturing organisations, but none had the financial power to start construction.

[^2]: Technical and industrial department

Response from the French industry was strong, with every major manufacturer sending in at least one proposal, and a total of 20 different designs were received. Most of the proposals used all-[turbojet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbojet) power, although [Breguet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breguet_Aviation) entered a number of designs for both turbojet and [turboprop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboprop) types; among these was one for an Atar-powered tri-jet to be developed in association with the [SNCA du Nord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nord_Aviation) and a turboprop type, all known as **Br. 978**. Hurel-Dubois entered several turboprop designs based on a narrow fuselage and shoulder mounted wing similar to many regional propliners. Proposals from the [SNCA du Sud-Ouest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNCA_du_Sud-Ouest) included the **S.O.60** with two [Rolls-Royce Avon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Avon) RA.7 engines, with two smaller [Turbomeca Marborés](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbomeca_Marbor%C3%A9) as auxiliaries. [SNCA du Sud-Est](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNCA_du_Sud-Est) (SNCASE) returned a number of designs from the **X-200** to **X-210**, all of them pure-jet.

### Caravelle I

Similar to the original prototypes; first flew on 14 May 1958. This variant was powered by two Rolls-Royce RA-29 Avon Mk.522 with 4,763 [kgf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force) (46,710 [N](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit)); 10,500 [lbf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound-force)) of unitary thrust and a capacity of 80 passengers. The French certification was obtained on 2 April 1959, and the [FAA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration) certification was obtained six days later. The first revenue flight took place in that same year with Air France in the Paris-Rome-Athens–Istanbul route. The Air France Caravelle F-BHRB "Lorraine" was introduced in the Paris-London route on 27 July 1959.  
Sales: 20 sold; to [Air France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France) (10), SAS (6), [Air Algérie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Alg%C3%A9rie) (2), and VARIG (2). One of the [VARIG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VARIG) examples was leased by Sud to [Air Vietnam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Vietnam) and [Middle East Airlines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_Airlines) before delivery to [Royal Air Maroc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Maroc).

In Australia, [TAA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAA) had planned to re-equip with the Caravelle but as Ansett felt this was too advanced at that stage for their own needs, both airlines were required to purchase the [Ansett](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansett) preference; the less advanced turbo-prop [Lockheed L-188 Electra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_L-188_Electra).

### Caravelle IA

This variant had the same external configuration as variant I but with more powerful engines, the Rolls-Royce Avon RA-29/1 Mk.526. Obviously, with improved capabilities. The first flight took place on 11 February 1960. Variants I and IA were later converted to the III variant.

Sales: 12 built. Deliveries were to [Air France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France), [SAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_Airlines_System), Air Algérie, [Finnair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnair), and [Royal Air Maroc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Maroc).

### Caravelle III

Later improvements of the Avon led to the Caravelle III. It first flew on 30 December 1959, beginning service with [Alitalia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alitalia) in April 1960. The Caravelle III was powered with Rolls-Royce Avon RA-29/3 Mk.527 and RA-29/3 Mk.527B, both with 5,170 [kgf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram-force) (50,700 [N](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit)); 11,400 [lbf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound-force)) of unitary thrust.

Sales: The Series III was the best-selling Caravelle with 78 built. Of the 32 Series I, 31 were upgraded to Series III standard. [Air Inter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Inter) used 16 of this type for its domestic routes. Major deliveries to [Air France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France), as well as examples for [Swissair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swissair), [Alitalia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alitalia), [SAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_Airlines_System), and [Royal Air Maroc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Maroc).

Project Mercury
===============

Creation
--------

Project Mercury was officially approved 7 October 1958 and publicly announced on 17 December. Originally it was called Project Astronaut, but president Eisenhower thought that it gave too much attention to the pilot. Instead the name Mercury was chosen from Greek-Roman mythology, which already lent name to rockets like Atlas and Jupiter. It absorbed military projects with the same aim such as the Air Force Man-in-Space-Soonest.

### Background

#### Following the end of World War II

Following the end of World War II, a nuclear arms race evolved between the US and the Soviet Union to develop long-range missiles. At the same time both sides also developed satellites for espionage. Most of this took place in secret, therefore it came as a shock to the US public when the Soviet Union placed the first satellite into orbit in October 1957 and there was a growing fear in the US that it was falling behind. A month later the Soviet launched a dog into orbit and though it was not retained it was obvious that they were striving at manned spaceflight. Unable to tell the public about the progress of military space projects, president Eisenhower decided to create a civilian space agency NASA, based on NACA, a federal aeronautical research agency. NASA should take care of civilian and scientific space exploration and after having orbited an American satellite in 1958 the next goal became to put a man in space.

#### The limit of space

The limit of space was defined as an altitude of 62 mi (100 km) and the only way to reach it was by rocket. This created risks for the pilot, including explosion, subjection to high g-force and vibrations during lift off through the atmosphere. In space, the pilot would experience zero gravity, a condition where he might suffer from disorientation. In this altitude he had to be in a pressurized chamber or suit and supplied with fresh air. Further possible risks were radiation from space[18] and micrometeoroids, from which the air would normally protect him. At reentry to the denser part of the atmosphere, air friction would heat the spacecraft to more than 10,000 °F (5,540 °C).

>All these obstacles, however, seemed possible to overcome. Experiences from satellites suggested that the risk from micrometeoroids was negligible. As to the medical questions, experiments in the early 1950s with simulated weightlessness and high g-forces on humans together with experiments of sending animals to the limit of space gave the conclusion that problems could be overcome by known technology.

Finally, reentry was studied with nuclear warhead of ballistic missiles. From this, the best solution to the heating problem was found to be a blunt heatshield facing the direction of movement during reentry since it created a shock wave that lead most of the heat around the spacecraft or warhead.

### Organization and facilities

#### T. Keith Glennan had been appointed administrator

##### Administrator of NASA

T. Keith Glennan had been appointed administrator of NASA with Hugh L. Dryden (director of NACA) his deputy from the creation of the agency on 1 October 1958. Glennan would report to the president through the National Aeronautics and Space Council. The group responsible for project Mercury was NASA's Space Task Group and the goals of the program were to orbit a manned spacecraft around Earth, investigate the pilot's ability to function in space and to recover both pilot and spacecraft safely.

##### Existing technology

Existing technology and off-the-shelf equipment should be used wherever practical, the simplest and most reliable approach to system design would be followed, an existing launch vehicle would be employed together with a progressive test program.

###### Spacecraft requirements

Spacecraft requirements included: a launch escape system to separate the spacecraft and its occupant from the launch vehicle in case of impending failure; attitude control for orientation of spacecraft in orbit; a retrorocket system to bring the spacecraft out of orbit; drag braking blunt body for atmospheric reentry; and landing on water.

###### Communicate with the spacecraft

To communicate with the spacecraft during an orbital mission a network had to be built.
