# Markdown Utilities

## Markdown Setup

[Atom](https://atom.io/) for editing, along with the excellent [Marked](https://marked2app.com/) for rendering.
[TableFlip](TableFlip) for table-heavy documents.

Atom setup:

- [Hypest](https://hector.me/hypest-atom) UI and syntax themes
- [document-outline](https://atom.io/packages/document-outline), [folding-markdown](https://atom.io/packages/folding-markdown), [smart-quotes-plus](https://atom.io/packages/smart-quotes-plus), [wordcount](https://atom.io/packages/wordcount) packages
- Personal prefs: disable `tree-view` package, set `Editor/Tab Length` to `4`

## Stylesheets

Custom CSS style for Marked. Could be reused elsewhere, provided `#wrapper` selectors are removed.
